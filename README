NAME
    Elasticsearch::Cxn::NetCurl - A Cxn implementation which uses libcurl
    via Net::Curl

VERSION
    version 1.00

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an HTTP Cxn class based on Net::Curl. The "NetCurl" Cxn class
    is very fast and uses persistent connections but requires XS and
    "libcurl".

    This class does Elasticsearch::Role::Cxn::HTTP, whose documentation
    provides more information.
