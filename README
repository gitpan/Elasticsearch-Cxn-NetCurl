NAME
    Elasticsearch::Cxn::NetCurl - A Cxn implementation which uses Net::Cul

VERSION
    version 0.02

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an HTTP Cxn class based on Net::Curl. The "NetCurl" Cxn class
    is very fast and uses persistent connections but requires XS and
    libcurl.

    This class does Elasticsearch::Role::Cxn::HTTP, whose documentation
    provides more information.

    This module overrides the defaults from Elasticsearch::Role::Cxn as
    sub-second timeouts don't work on all platforms. Defaults are:

    *   "ping_timeout": 1 second

    *   "sniff_request_timeout": 1 second

    *   Elasticsearch::Role::Cxn::HTTP

    *   Elasticsearch::Cxn::LWP

    *   Elasticsearch::Cxn::HTTPTiny
